Beggining:

There once was a man named Hodge. He loved to play sports and draw sketches. He loved to sketch his surroudings, especailly landscapes. However, one day a
robber robbed his house and took all the sketches he worked so hard to draw. The only things the robber left was a map to where he lived. Furious, Hodge 
set out to find his sketches and posses them once more. The following day he set out on his adventure. The first thing that he encountered was a fire
breathing hamster. He used his magic wand to defeat the hamster and scare it away. The next thing he encountered was even scarier.
